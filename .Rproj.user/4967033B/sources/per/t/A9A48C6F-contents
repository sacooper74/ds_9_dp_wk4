## Run Prediction

- The Shiny app predicts your race pace (seconds or minutes per kilometer) based upon your cadence (strides per minute).
- It is based upon personal Garmin data gathered over the course of a number of years.
- Predictions are based on a linear model of outcome average pace with predictor of average cadence.
- Predictions are averaged across multiple terrains, elevation and weather.
- A future release of this product will enable users to input these other predictors.

## Structure of Data
The data is based upon personal Garmin data gathered over a course of a number of years.  
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggcorrplot)

# import the dataset
runlog <- read_csv("runlog.csv", 
                   col_types = list(AvgPace = col_time(format = "%M:%S")))
runlog$AvgCadence <- as.numeric(runlog$AvgCadence)
runlog$pace_num <- as.numeric(as.POSIXct(runlog$AvgPace, "%M:%S", tz = GMT))
```
The dataset has `r dim(runlog)[1]` rows and `r dim(runlog)[2]` columns. Field names and header:
```{r str}
# dim(runlog)
# str(runlog)
# summary(runlog)
names(runlog)

head(runlog, 1)
```

## The Model ~ Correlation, Coefficients and R Squared
A correlogram shows a strong correlation between cadence, elevation gain and pace: 
```{r head}
# We can use Correlogram to look at this
nums <- sapply(runlog, is.numeric)
corr <- round(cor(runlog[,nums]), 1)
ggcorrplot(corr, lab = T, lab_size = 3, method = "circle", colors = c("tomato2", "white", "springgreen3"))

# Model creation
model2 <- lm(pace_num ~ AvgCadence + ElevGain, data = runlog)

# summary(model2)$coefficients
# summary(model2)$adj.r.squared

# Stepwise model creation
# model3 <- step(lm(data = runlog, pace_num ~ runlog[,nums]), trace = 0, steps = 10000)
```

The linear model shows that pace decreases by `r round(model2$coefficient[2],2)` seconds for every unit increase in strides per minute.  This relationship accounts for more than `r round(summary(model2)$adj.r.squared,2)` of the variance in pace.
